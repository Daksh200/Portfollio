          Hey there, I’m Daksh. I’m not a therapist, a doctor, or a wellness guru—I’m just someone who believes in the power of human connection and the healing that comes from moving together. I live in Mysuru, and over the past year, I’ve been part of a small but deeply committed group called <strong>The 7th Circle</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
          We’re a team of seven friends who decided to do something different about depression—not by prescribing pills, but by offering presence, movement, and shared strength. And I’m here to share our story—not as a promotion, but as a testament to what simple, consistent effort can do.

        <h2>🧠 Understanding Depression</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Depression is more than just feeling sad. It's a serious mood disorder that affects how you feel, think, and handle daily activities. While occasional sadness is normal, persistent feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, or a lack of interest in activities once enjoyed can be signs of depression.
        </p>
        <h3>Common Symptoms of Depression</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Persistent sadness or low mood</strong>: Feeling down, empty, or hopeless most of the day.</li>
          <li><strong>Loss of interest or pleasure</strong>: A marked disinterest in activities that once brought joy.</li>
          <li><strong>Fatigue or low energy</strong>: Feeling physically drained and lacking motivation.</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep disturbances</strong>: Experiencing insomnia or sleeping excessively.</li>
          <li><strong>Appetite or weight changes</strong>: Significant weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting.</li>
          <li><strong>Difficulty concentrating</strong>: Trouble focusing, making decisions, or remembering things.</li>
          <li><strong>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</strong>: Harsh self-criticism or excessive guilt.</li>
          <li><strong>Thoughts of death or suicide</strong>: Persistent thoughts about ending one's life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          If you're experiencing several of these symptoms nearly every day for at least two weeks, it's important to seek professional help. Depression is treatable, and support is available.

        <h2>🌱 Our Approach: Movement, Not Medication</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          We didn’t have fancy certifications or a clinical setup. What we had was a shared belief that:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 italic my-6">
          <p><strong>“Healing begins when we move—together.”</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          We started with a simple idea: instead of waiting for people to come to us, we’d go to them. We reached out to six individuals in our community who were facing depression. They were isolated, overwhelmed, and unsure where to turn.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          We offered them something simple: daily group walks, shared yoga sessions, and open conversations. No judgment. No pressure. Just presence.
        </p>

        <h2>💪 The Results: Six Stories of Recovery</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Over the course of three months, all six individuals showed remarkable improvement. They reported better sleep, increased energy, and a renewed sense of purpose. Their smiles returned. Their confidence grew. They reconnected with their communities.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          One of them, Rahul shared:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 italic my-6">
          <p>“I didn’t think I could feel joy again. But walking with you all, laughing, talking—it brought me back to life.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>🧘‍♂️ Why It Worked</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          We didn’t have a magic formula. But we did have consistency and compassion. Research supports our approach:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Endorphins & Neurotrophic Factors</strong>: Physical activity triggers the release of endorphins, the brain's natural mood lifters. It also stimulates neurotrophic factors that promote the growth of new neural connections, enhancing brain function and mood regulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Hippocampus Health</strong>: Regular movement helps strengthen the hippocampus—the brain region responsible for regulating mood—counteracting the effects of depression.</li>
          <li><strong>Confidence & Social Connection</strong>: Exercise boosts self-esteem and provides opportunities for social interaction, both of which are vital for mental well-being.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔥 Daksh’s Twist: The Power of the 7th Breath</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          In our sessions, we emphasized the importance of the seventh breath. It’s a symbolic moment where we pause, inhale deeply, and exhale all the negativity. This simple act reminded us that healing begins with a single breath.
        </p>

        <h2>📢 Final Thoughts</h2>
        
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Depression is a complex journey, but it doesn’t have to be walked alone. At The 7th Circle, we believe in the power of movement, mindfulness, and community to heal. Together, we can rise above.
